          Looking in the mirror and self-evaluating can be a most difficult and tedious task. After several iterations over the years, (branding back in 2007 and officially declaring a DBA), I’ve finalized the logo, identity, general concept, skill set and direction of work.

          With solely a stated ‘western’ motif to work with, the process took me through several entirely different variations before a finalized logo was agreed upon. Subtext and imagery associated in each variation culminated in the final approved product.

          Another client just wanted a revamp on an existing logo and color scheme – after just two iterations, we found a suitable design that was close enough to keep their identity stable, yet modernized their look to the extent they desired.

          This client operates two entities, Open Country LLC. and Open Country Equipment. Initially I took divergent paths, focusing on their main business (OCE) - after discussing we decided that it would be most successful keeping the two visually entwined.

          M2M or Married to Massage is a project that has evolved over the past 6 years. The client approached me for my skill - after rebranding her independent marrage therapy business, she emerged excited and grateful for the message the identity sends.

          This client was starting a new business and needed everything - a strong identity, social media accounts and imagery, and a cohesive website.

          This is an exploratory project for a former employer. I sought to upgrade their identity’s look and feel.
